# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) System - For Handwritten Text

Optical Character Recognition System in simple terms is something that generates document text from a scanned image of the text. There are several OCR systems out there, however most of them fails on Handwritten Texts. **Why is it so?** This mainly is because of the variety of writing styles of people around the world. OCR is still not perfect and is a subject of research.

Here, we are trying to contribute a little in the area for handwritten classification. 
This repository contains a web interface for an OCR system that is able to classify handwritten text.

Although, there is a restriction on the user: **All the text to be classified must be in all English Uppercase**. This was a necessary restriction to impose due to the following reasons:

* Lack of proper amount of data to train the model on.
* Lack of appropriate resources (hardware like GPUs) to train the model on.
