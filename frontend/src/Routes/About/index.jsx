<h1><u>OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</u></h1>
<br/>
<p> OCR (optical character recognition) is the use of technology to distinguish printed or handwritten text characters inside digital images of physical documents, such as a scanned paper document. The basic process of OCR involves examining the text of a document and translating the characters into code that can be used for data processing. OCR is sometimes also referred to as text recognition.</p>
<br/>
<p>OCR systems are made up of a combination of hardware and software that is used to convert physical documents into machine-readable text. Hardware, such as an optical scanner or specialized circuit board is used to copy or read text while software typically handles the advanced processing. Software can also take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) to implement more advanced methods of intelligent character recognition (ICR), like identifying languages or styles of handwriting.</p>
<br/>
<p>The process of OCR is most commonly used to turn  hard copy  legal or historic documents into PDFs. Once placed in this soft copy, users can edit, format and search the document as if it was created with a word processor.</p>
<br/>
<h3><u>
How optical character recognition works</u></h3>
<br/>
<p>The first step of OCR is using a scanner to process the physical form of a document. Once all pages are copied, OCR software converts the document into a two-color, or black and white, version. The scanned-in image or bitmap is analyzed for light and dark areas, where the dark areas are identified as characters that need to be recognized and light areas are identified as background.</p>
<br/>
<p>The dark areas are then processed further to find alphabetic letters or numeric digits. OCR programs can vary in their techniques, but typically involve targeting one character, word or block of text at a time</p>

<h3><u>
Benefits of optical character recognition</u></h3>
<br/>
<p>The main advantages of OCR technology are saved time, decreased errors and minimized effort. It also enables actions that are not capable with physical copies such as compressing into ZIP files, highlighting keywords, incorporating into a website and attaching to an email.

While taking images of documents enables them to be digitally archived, OCR provides the added functionality of being able to edit and search those documents.</p>
